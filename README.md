# Bresenham in Javascript / P5JS
Using the bresenham algorithm to rasterize animated lines, based on [p5js-boilerplate](https://github.com/bsplt/p5js-boilerplate).

>Bresenham's line algorithm is an algorithm that determines the points of an n-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two points. It is commonly used to draw line primitives in a bitmap image (e.g. on a computer screen), as it uses only integer addition, subtraction and bit shifting, all of which are very cheap operations in standard computer architectures. It is an incremental error algorithm.
